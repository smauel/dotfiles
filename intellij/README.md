# IntelliJ Settings

## Whats included?

All checkboxes in the settings export dialog have been ticked. This probably
includes more than is required

## Importing

1. Open IntelliJ
2. File -> Manage IDE Settings -> Import Settings
3. Select the `settings.zip` file
4. Choose the settings you want to apply and click 'OK'

## Exporting

1. Open IntelliJ
2. File -> Manage IDE Settings -> Export Settings
3. Select to override the `settings.zip` file
4. Choose the settings you want to apply and click 'OK'

## Settings Repository

IntelliJ also has a feature to sync with a remote repository, which can be
configured to point at the repo in github. Updates can also be synced back to
the repo from the IDE itself, meaning you don't need to go through the 'Export'
steps listed above.
